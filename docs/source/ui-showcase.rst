UI Showcase
===========

The following mock-ups highlight the refreshed RaspyRFM panel.

Captured signal classification
------------------------------

   :figwidth: 100%

   Incoming payloads display suggested entity types and actions.  One click
   applies the template to the creation form, which adapts the required
   fields automatically.

Device inventory controls
-------------------------

.. figure:: _static/raspyrfm-device-list.svg

   The device list now surfaces per-action send buttons, button groups, and
   universal receivers so you can replay signals directly from the panel.
